# README: Python Mini-Projects  

### Overview  
This repository contains three exciting Python mini-projects that demonstrate fundamental programming skills and creativity:  
1. **Snake Game**  
2. **Tic Tac Toe**  
3. **Digital Clock**  

Each project is designed to enhance your understanding of Python and offers practical exposure to key concepts like game loops, GUI creation, and real-time functionality.

### Projects  

#### 1. Snake Game  
The **Snake Game** is a recreation of the classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions.  
- **Features**:  
  - Smooth gameplay with real-time snake movement.  
  - Collision detection for walls and the snake's body.  
  - Dynamic growth as the snake eats food.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python with **Pygame** or **Tkinter**.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Run the script, use arrow keys to control the snake, and try to score as high as possible!

#### 2. Tic Tac Toe  
A two-player strategy game implemented in Python, where the goal is to form a straight line with your symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.  
- **Features**:  
  - Validates moves and identifies winning or draw conditions.  
  - Optional single-player mode with an AI opponent.  
  - Interactive interface (text-based or graphical using **Tkinter**).  
- **How to Run**:  
  Launch the script and follow the on-screen prompts to play.

#### 3. Digital Clock  
A real-time digital clock that displays the current time in a graphical user interface.  
- **Features**:  
  - Continuously updates the displayed time.  
  - Customizable appearance with fonts and colors.  
  - Optional advanced features like alarms and time zone support.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python with **Tkinter**.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Execute the script to display the live clock in a GUI window.

#### 4. Sudoku Validator  
The **Sudoku Validator** is a Python program that verifies whether a given 9x9 Sudoku board complies with Sudoku rules.  
- **Features**:  
  - Validates rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-boxes for duplicates.  
  - Efficient use of a `set` for tracking seen numbers.  
  - Handles incomplete boards with empty cells represented by `.`.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Pass a 9x9 board (list of lists) to the `isValidSudoku` function and get a boolean result indicating validity.
  

### Requirements  
- **Python Version**: 3.9+  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pygame: `pip install pygame` (if using Pygame for Snake Game)  
  - Tkinter: Pre-installed with Python  

---

### How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   cd python-mini-projects  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.  
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash  
   python <project_name>.py  
   ```

### Learning Outcomes  
These projects are ideal for beginners and help in learning:  
- Game development concepts (loops, event handling, collision detection).  
- GUI creation with libraries like **Tkinter** and **Pygame**.  
- Working with Pythonâ€™s `time` and `datetime` modules.  


We hope you enjoy these projects! Feedback and contributions are always welcome. ðŸŽ‰
